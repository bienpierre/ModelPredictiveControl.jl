# Mass-Spring Damper system
Consider a mass-string-damper system. The state space model is equal to:

```math
\dot{x}(t) = 
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\
				-\frac{k}{m} & - \frac{b}{m}
\end{bmatrix}
		 x(t) + 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\frac{1}{m}
\end{bmatrix}
		 u(t)
```
Where, m is the mass in ``kg ``, k is the spring constant in   `` N/m ``, b is the damping constant in `` Ns/m `` and u the input force in ``N ``.

```math
m = 1.0 kg \\
k = 1.0 N/m \\
b = 0.2 Ns/m \\
```
